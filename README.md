# FarmGame
Hello and welcome to our group's coding project, the group members are Phuc, Flynn, Edward.
For this project we created a farm simulator game called farmville, which is played with a mixture of the terminal and sfml
graphics. This game is allows users to simulate farm life including the planting and harvesting of crops, and the 
ownership of animals, which can be harvested for their products or slaughtered for their meat. On each day, 
all plants must be watered, and must be at the maximum watering level to be able to grow (watering level is displayed in the
terminal after watering). As well as this, they must be fertilised when planted, which can be bought from the shop. Animals 
must be both fed and watered every day as well, and must be at maximum feed and water to be able to produce eggs or wool.
Animals also have a lifespan, which causes them to perish after a set amount of time. Chickens die after 10 days, while sheep die after 15.

When in the game,

press h : for help
press p : for next day
press i : for inventory
press b : to open the shop

do not stress though, instructions will help you in every step of the way!

Enjoy the game!
